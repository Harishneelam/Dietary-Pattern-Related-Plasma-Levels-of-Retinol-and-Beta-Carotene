- Some Research studies has revealed that low plasma concentrations of retinol, beta-carotene, or other carotenoids may be linked to a higher risk of developing certain forms of cancer.
- However, only a small number of research have looked into the factors that affect the plasma concentrations of these micronutrients.
- I wish to create a Machine learning model which determines the association between dietary components, personal traits, and plasma concentrations of retinol and beta-carotene.
- Study subjects were patients who underwent elective surgery to biopsy or remove a lesion of the lung, colon, breast, skin, ovary, or uterus within a three-year period. Only two analytes are present in the data.
